  "summary": "Both REQ-13 and REQ-14 appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-13 is addressed by fixing the backend registerUser function, updating useQueries.ts with a useRegisterUser mutation that calls actor.registerUser(displayName), and updating SetupPage.tsx to use useRegisterUser instead of useSaveCallerUserProfile. REQ-14 is addressed in ChatHeader.tsx by reading the principal from useInternetIdentity and displaying it in a styled monospace block with copy-to-clipboard functionality inside the dropdown menu.",
