  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for the 'Failed to create profile' error across backend and frontend. REQ-10 is partially addressed with a new backend profile storage approach (saveCallerUserProfile instead of registerUser). REQ-11 and REQ-12 are substantially implemented in SetupPage.tsx and useQueries.ts. However, several specific acceptance criteria have gaps.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Re-calling registerUser for an existing principal returns an appropriate response without overwriting the profile unintentionally.",
      "reason": "The backend uses saveCallerUserProfile which calls userProfiles.add(caller, profile) unconditionally with no guard preventing overwrite of an existing profile and no distinct response for an already-registered user.",

        "backend/main.mo"

    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "The useRegisterUser mutation in useQueries.ts uses the correct Candid argument and return types matching the deployed backend.",
      "reason": "The diff replaces useRegisterUser entirely with useSaveCallerUserProfile. The spec explicitly names useRegisterUser as the mutation to fix, and no such export exists in the modified useQueries.ts.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Errors are logged to the browser console with enough detail including error object, principal, and canister ID.",
      "reason": "The error logging in SetupPage includes the error object and principal but does not include the canister ID, which is explicitly required by the acceptance criteria.",
