  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations — adds `useRegisterUser` mutation that calls `actor.registerUser(displayName)` for first-time user registration (correctly assigns the `#user` role), updates `useGetCurrentUser` to accept an optional `principalOverride` string so the caller's principal can be injected from `useInternetIdentity`, and retains all existing profile, chat UI, and project/workflow/task CRUD hooks.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root app component that uses the corrected `useGetCallerUserProfile` hook (with the flash-prevention `isFetched` guard from the authorization component docs) to route between LoginPage, SetupPage, and ChatPage, and invalidates the profile query on setup completion instead of relying on a local `setupComplete` flag.",

  "frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx": "Main chat layout with responsive two-panel design — updated to read the caller's principal from `useInternetIdentity` and pass it as `principalOverride` to `useGetCurrentUser`, ensuring the principal is populated in the `ChatUser` object used throughout the page.",
  "frontend/src/components/ChatHeader.tsx": "App header with logo, theme toggle, and user dropdown — updated to read the principal directly from `useInternetIdentity` (falling back to `currentUser.principal`), display it in a styled monospace block with a copy-to-clipboard button inside the dropdown, and show a checkmark confirmation after copying.",
  "frontend/src/components/ConversationList.tsx": "Left sidebar showing conversation list with search, skeleton loading, empty states, and a New Chat dialog — updated to import `ChatUser` and `Conversation` (instead of `UserProfile`) from `useQueries` and use `ChatUser` throughout all prop types and internal logic.",
